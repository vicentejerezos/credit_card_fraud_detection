This Dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. 
It presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807, so the dataset is highly imbalanced.
Our goal is to correctly identify fraudulent credit card transactions.

## PROJECT PLANNING 
1) Understand nature of the data.
2) Data exploration: Countplots, Boxplots, Distplots, Histograms, etc...
3) Scaling Data.
4) Correlation betweeen the metrics.
5) Outliers.
6) Resampling the Dataset:
	6.1) Under Sampling.
	6.2) Over Sampling

7) Model performance:
	7.1) Logistic Regression.
	7.2) Decision Tree Classifier. 
	7.3) Random Forest Classifier.
	7.4) KNeighbors Classifier.
	7.5) SVC classifier.


8) Compare models.
9) Use the whole Dataset with the best model.
